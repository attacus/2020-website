bio: <p>I am mathematical physicist and a junior lecturer for the Learn Programming
  Academy. I took up Python programming during my degree independently of my studies
  because it seemed like a good idea at the time, and never looked back. My interests
  include procedural generation, games development, and blockchain. Don't ask me about
  blockchain because I'm still learning.</p>
