bio: "<p>I am currently studying Complex Systems to learn how disastrous societies\
  \ emerge from well meaning people. I am looking deeply at the Federal Elections\
  \ Commission data to understand how political contributions spread throughout networks\
  \ of people and political committees. In general, I hope to figure out how to turn\
  \ large scale public agreement for change into systemic improvements.</p>\n<p>During\
  \ the work day I teach students and teachers how to understand the data, algorithms\
  \ and the digital systems in the world around them. Including creating virtual environments\
  \ for students to explore hacking in an ethically and technically safe way and designing\
  \ curricula for students to learn the fundamentals of the web, APIs and team based\
  \ software projects.</p>"
