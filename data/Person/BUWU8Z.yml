name: Elena Williams
pronouns: (not at all fussed but she/her/they/their ... she? <3 :)
bio: <p>Elena cares deeply about Python and the community. Elena has been using python
  since 2005ish and has been coding the web for money for a while longer than that.
  She moonlights in computer science at ANU, she's proudly part of the CPUG organising
  team, she's a member of the Python Software Foundation (which we all should be!
  https://www.python.org/psf/membership/ ) and an elected member of the Django Software
  Foundation. Through happy coincidences she is both a founding PyLady and a founding
  DjangoGirl and has tried to do her best in both these organisations. She's spent
  more time with tabulated data than a sane person should; she watched the Ed Finkler
  talk with the same title as this talk a couple of years ago and it really did. She
  is a Neo4j certified professional.</p>
