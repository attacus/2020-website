  \ a wide range of constructed facilities. I am a director of the Society of Construction\
  \ Law Australia and a member of the Singapore International Mediation Centre's Panel\
  \ of Experts.</p>\n<p>In 2020 I completed the Brady Review, an investigation into\
  \ the causes of fatalities in the mining industry in Queensland, Australia. This\
  \ review analysed 20 years of incident and fatality information, was data driven,\
  \ and culminated in 11 recommendations for both industry and the regulator on how\
  \ to lower the fatality and incident rate.</p>"
