bio: <p>I run the Education business unit at City Network, and help people learn to
  use, understand, and deploy OpenStack. Together with my Education team I run academy.citycloud.com,
  a learning platform based on the open source Open edX software stack. I've worked
  exclusively with open source software since about 2002. I ran hastexo, a small professional
  services company specializing in OpenStack, Ceph, and Open edX, until our acquisition
  by City Network in October 2017. I have presented at several OpenStack/OpenInfra
  Summits, LinuxCnns, linux.conf.au's, OSCONs, and numerous other conferences and
  meetups</p>
