name: Riley Clement
bio: <p>After completing a B.Math and B.CompSci through University of Newcastle, Riley
  undertook a PhD in Math to pursue his two major interests at the time; integer programming,
  and remaining a student for as long as possible.  Riley is currently employed at
  Hunter Valley Coal Chain Coordinator (HVCCC) in the Strategic Planning Team (SPT),
  which indulges his appetite for all things Operations Research (OR), and acronyms.  His
  role at HVCCC has involved applying his skills to the development of simulation
  models, metaheuristics, and tools for data analysis.</p>
