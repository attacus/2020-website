pronouns: He/Him/His
bio: <p>Yaakov is a Senior Developer at WiseTech Global, and has an unfortunate habit
  of sticking his nose in all the wrong places. He has been writing and breaking code
  for many years, and has reverse-engineered everything from mobile apps to the Steam
  client. In his spare time he can often be observed &lt;del&gt;roving around Sydney
  trying to catch Pok√©mon&lt;/del&gt; &lt;ins&gt;staying at home&lt;/ins&gt;.</p>
