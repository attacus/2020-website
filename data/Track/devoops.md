This is the first year that the DevOops track has been hosted at PyCon AU, and it's all about learning from failure. 

A lot of conference talks are about things going right, and
not a lot are about when things went wrong, which is weird
because things tend to go wrong a lot. We want to celebrate all the things we can learn from when
things go wrong.

And even if this track fails terribly, we'll have even more
to talk about next year.

With this track, failure is success!
