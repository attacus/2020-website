This is the first year that the DevOops track has been hosted at PyCon AU, and it's all about learning from failure. 

A lot of conference talks are about things going right, and not a lot are about
when things went wrong, which is weird because things tend to go wrong a lot.

We want to celebrate all the things we can learn from when things go wrong.

It's Science!

Come and show us all the things you tried that didn't work so we all learn what
not to do next time. Trying and failing is an important part of learning, and
PyConline is all about learning things from each other.

Talking about failure means being vulnerable, but PyCon AU is a super-welcoming
and caring community, so we think it's a great place for people to come and
share what happened when things didn't go as planned. `#hugops` is a thing!

If you've never spoken before, DevOops is the perfect track for you because
failure is an inherently interesting topic. Come and tell us about a time you
tried something new and it didn't work! Help long-time programmers learn
what's weird for newcomers so we can make it even easier to get started.

And even if this track fails terribly, we'll have even more to talk about next year.

With this track, failure is success!
