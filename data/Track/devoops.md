This is the first year that the DevOops track has been hosted at PyCon AU, and it's all about learning from failure. 

At a lot of conference we speak about times that things went well and right, and not a lot about when things went horribly wrong. There's a lot to learn from these experiences. `#hugops` is a thing!

Talking about failure is vulnerable, but PyCon AU is a welcoming community, and hearing about failure is an inherently interesting topic that we want to hear about (from you!)

(Even if this track fails terribly, we'll have even more to talk about next year. Failure is success!)
