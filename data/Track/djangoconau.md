DjangoCon AU isn't just about Django, but about all Python web development frameworks. 

It's also been a theme to bring in web developers from outside the Django community; talks about Drupal, Rails, etc, have been hosted in the past. 

If you're looking for talks on Django, have ideas about how to bring Django forward, or things that will make Django better, to submit.
