Teaching the basics of software development is hard, so itâ€™s best to get them while theyâ€™re young. Not just development in Python, but also visual programming languages. The Education Specialist Track brings together both educators and creators of educational tools to discuss ideas to help the next generation of programmers.


**What about the student showcase?**

This was started a few years ago, as shorter pitches presented by students. It doesn't have to be in the classroom, it can be a personal project.

If you want to submit to the Student Showcase, you can submit here: [https://forms.gle/F6JhtbFoZhVBzvz16](https://forms.gle/F6JhtbFoZhVBzvz16)
