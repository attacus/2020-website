**[Submit to the Student Showcase!](https://forms.gle/F6JhtbFoZhVBzvz16)**

With the Education track (and the entire event being online this year, this is a great oppourtinuty to get a bunch of voices that would otherwise be really difficult to hear from in an in-person event. 

We are particularly interested in regional teachers and students to submit a talk for this track. 

What's our jam? Anything that relates to teaching or learning Python, what's worked and what hasn't worked (and/or failed spectacularly!)

It's not only for educators or teachers. It's for anyone who is interested in the technology curriculum, and how to guide new coders through this landscape. 

We love hearing about classroom topics, about extra curricular topics. From primary through to tertiary, we want to hear about it. 

You do not need to be an expert in order to present!

**What about the student showcase?**

This was started a few years ago, as shorter pitches presented by students. It doesn't have to be in the classroom, it can be a personal project.
