Welcome to PyConline AU! We're glad you're here. 

Purchased a ticket and need to know how to join us? Check your order for the "Join online event" link. This will take you to our event hosted on Venueless. 

The conference schedule is slightly shorter this year running over three days instead of five. Like you, we’re also spending a lot of time in front of screens at home and we’ve been extremely mindful to ensure there are scheduled breaks and some time to spend offline as well.

On **Friday 4 September**, our 5 specialist tracks will stream in 4 virtual rooms.  There are 39 sessions for you to choose from on Friday, or pick a single track and stay tuned all day. [Check out the schedule for Friday](/program/fri/)

On **Saturday 5 September** we’re running what’s traditionally referred to as the ‘main conference’, a day full of talks on all sorts of wide ranging topics. There are 35 talks vying for your attention on Saturday including our deep dive sessions, and a new format to PyConline AU - 15 minute short talks. [Check out the schedule for Saturday](/program/sat/)

On **Sunday 6 September**, we’ll be all sorts of activities, from mentored sprints to coding competitions. [Check out the details for Sunday](/program/sun/)

If you haven't yet gotten your ticket, you can still join us!
