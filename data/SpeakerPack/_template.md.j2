Hello speakers!

Thank you so much for speaking at PyConline AU this year! We know you're super busy getting ready to present, but 

 Because we're online, things are a bit different! We know there's a lot covered, but please read everything here closely.

## Key dates

{%- if type == 'pre-record' %}
- You need to tell us you are pre-recording by **15 August**.
- Your recording (if we are helping you with it) will take place on **22-23 August**.
- Your video file (if you are preparing it yourself) is due in by **23 August**.
{%- endif %}
{%- if type == 'live' %}
- Rehearsals and tech tests for speakers are on **22-23 August**.
{%- endif %}
- Your presentation goes to air {% if day == 'specialist' %}**Friday 4 September**{% elif day == 'main' %}**Saturday 5 September**{% endif %}.
{%- if type == 'pre-record' %}

**Warning:** If you miss these dates, you may not be able to pre-record, and may need to default back to presenting live.
{%- endif %}

## Technical requirements

{% if type == 'live' and room == 'curlyboi' %}

The AV team will get in touch with you beforehand to run through the requirements for your stream.

{% elif type == 'live' and room == 'other' %}

- You'll need a webcam and microphone. If you have a webcam built into your laptop it's probably fine, but it's a good idea to plug in an external microphone if at all possible.
- You'll need the latest **Chrome** or **Firefox**. It's also a good idea to have **Skype** or **Zoom** installed, as we can fall back to these as a backup.
- You'll need a secondary monitor plugged into your computer, **or** a secondary device (such as a spare laptop, phone or tablet, but make sure it's set not to go to sleep!)

{% elif type == 'pre-record' %}

**TODO** tech specs

Because you are pre-recording, you will need to make your finished video **two minutes shorter** than the duration you selected&mdash;so either **13, 23 or 53 minutes**. It can run a little shorter but it **can not** run longer, even by a second.

{% endif %}

Please also look through our AV team's **quality tips**. They're really important reading, so we've made the button to go read them very big and very green.

## On the day, before your talk

- **Two hours before** your talk, go into the **green room chat** on Venueless, and let the channel know you have arrived for a tech check. The AV team will help check your set-up, and give last minute advice.
- **10 minutes before** your talk, the green room AV team will check you are ready. If you are not, your talk might get skipped!
{%- if room == 'curlyboi' %}

The AV team will get in touch with you beforehand to provide more information on how your stream will be managed.

{%- elif room == 'other' %}
- **5 minutes before** your talk, a "virtual curtain" will drop, and you'll be given a link to connect to the studio. When you open that link, you'll be able to see and hear the stream return video feed, and the **backstage chat**.
- **1 minute before** your talk, the virtual curtain will lift, and the MC will introduce you. (You'll see them and hear their voice through the stream return.)
{% endif %}

## During your talk

Your talk will run for **15, 25, or 55 minutes**, depending on what you selected when you submitted your proposal.

Your options for taking questions are:

- Accept questions live on the stream. The MC will curate questions and read them to you. If you choose this option, question time is **included in your talk time**.
- Discuss questions after the talk, via the "hallway" channels we provide (there will be text-only, audio and video options).
- Decline to take questions.

At the 5, 2, and 1 minute marks you'll get a countdown message in the backstage chat. **At the end of your allotted time** the MC will come back on stream, thank you for presenting, and the "virtual curtain" will drop.

**Talks will not be allowed to run over**, so the MC may have to interrupt you if you don't wrap up in time; to avoid this, make sure you have the stream chat open!

## After your talk

As soon as the curtain drops you can leave the studio. (In fact, you'll be encouraged to rather quickly, because our changeover procedures are tight!) We'd love it if you could then go into one of the "hallway track" spaces we provide, but you don't have to.

## What to do if something comes up

Sometimes things happen!

Laptops run out of power, slides go missing, family stuff comes up, physical or mental health problems can occur. If anything comes up at any point, please let Benno (our Program Chair) or one of the other conference organisers know. We have an experienced organising team who can help with a broad range of questions, issues, or concerns. The sooner you let us know if there is a problem, the sooner we can work with you to achieve the best possible outcome.
