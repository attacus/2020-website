Hello speakers!

Thank you so much for speaking at PyConline AU this year! We know you're super busy getting ready to present, but we have a few things we need you to read through!

 Because we're online, things are a bit different! We know there's a lot covered, but please read everything here closely.

## Key dates

{%- if type == 'pre-record' %}
- You need to tell us you are pre-recording by **15 August**.
- If you have applied and been accepted for an assisted pre-record slot, that will take place on **22-23 August**.
- Your video file (if you are preparing it yourself) is due in by **23 August**.
- In most cases, we cannot make edits or accept new versions after these dates.
{%- endif %}
{%- if type == 'live' %}
- Rehearsals and tech tests for speakers are on **22-23 August**. (You'll need to book a slot&mdash;more details will be sent out closer to the date.)
{%- endif %}
- Your presentation goes to air {% if day == 'specialist' %}**Friday 4 September**{% elif day == 'main' %}**Saturday 5 September**{% endif %}.
{%- if type == 'pre-record' %}

**Warning:** If you miss these dates, you may not be able to pre-record! If this happens, we may have to ask that you present live instead.
{%- endif %}

## Updating your talk information

If you need to update your talk information, you can [edit your accepted submission](https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2020/me/submissions/) on Pretalx.

If you haven't already, we need you to **tick the consent box that says we're allowed to stream your content**, otherwise we can't! You'll also be able to select whether you want to present live or pre-record, and optionally add content warnings if necessary (please read below for more detail on that).

In addition to that, you can make changes to your title, abstract, bio, and so on.

If you don't let us know that you want to pre-record by updating Pretalx before 15 August, we'll assume that you're presenting live.

{% if type == 'pre-record' %}

## Your options for pre-recording

If you want to pre-record, you have two options:

- **Pre-record by yourself**. This is the way to go if you want the best video and audio quality, if you don't want a dodgy Internet connection causing problems, or if you want to do something different and interesting with your video.
- **Apply for a slot to pre-record with our help**. We'll use roughly the same tools as we use on the day, but we'll record the output earlier and play it back. The quality will be the same as a livestream, and your Internet connection will still need to be up to scratch. {% if room != 'curlyboi' %}Limited slots are available, so not everyone that wants to do this will be able to.{% elif day == 'main' %}Limited slots are available for talks not scheduled for the Curlyboi Theatre, so if your talk is not scheduled there, you might not be able to.{% endif %}

Either way, **you need to let us know before 15 August** through Pretalx. If you [edit your accepted submission](https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2020/me/submissions/), you'll see a question you can use to indicate your preference. (This is *not* the same as the question that you were asked during the CFP process.)

With both options, we encourage you to invest time before your talk to ensure your recording setup is optimal (see below).  Clear audio especially will ensure your video is as engaging as possible, holding people’s attention for the duration of the talk.

### How much help will I get?

Our AV team and volunteers are able to provide tips and advice. However, in most cases we are unable to provide complex support, debug setups, or edit videos for you.

{% if room == 'curlyboi' %}
Some additional support is available for your stream, however; the AV team will get in touch with you with more details.
{% endif %}

{% endif %}

## Technical requirements

{% if type == 'live' %}
- You'll need a webcam and microphone. If you have a webcam built into your laptop it might be fine, but it's a good idea to plug in an external microphone if at all possible&mdash;you'll find more detail on our AV tips page linked below.
- You'll need a stable Internet connection. If you know you’ve got Internet issues (i.e. you usually have issues with video conferencing with work colleagues, your wifi drops out a lot, etc), please consider pre-recording instead.
- You'll need a secondary monitor plugged into your computer, **or** a secondary device (such as a spare laptop, phone or tablet, but make sure it's set not to go to sleep!) to display the chat / stream return feed separate to your screen sharing screen.  This is so we can communicate with you during your talk (if there is a problem, or reminders about time).
- You'll need the latest **Chrome** or **Firefox**. It's also a good idea to have **Skype** or **Zoom** installed, as we can fall back to these as a backup.
{%- if room == 'curlyboi' %}
- The stream you're on is a little different from the others&mdash;The AV team will get in touch with you beforehand to run through the requirements for your stream.
{% endif %}
{% elif type == 'pre-record' %}

- Video length: **two minutes shorter** than the duration you selected&mdash;so either **13, 23 or 53 minutes**. It can run a little shorter but it **can not** run longer, even by a second.
- Resolution: {% if room == 'curlyboi' %}1080p (1920x1080){% else %}720p (1280x720){% endif %}
{%- if day == 'main' %}
    - **Note**: If you don't know which stream you'll be in yet, note that the Curlyboi Theatre is 1080p, and the other streams are 720p.
{%- endif %}
- We can handle format re-conversion, but preference for format is below.
- We will email out upload details to those who opt-in to this.
- No video intro or outro sequence needed&mdash;if you include one, it may be edited out.
- You must be available in the conference Venueless stage during your talk, so you can answer questions!
- Editing needs to be done by you, and requesting changes after the due date is not possible. The AV team is expecting to have many hours of video to work through so we likely will not have the capacity to do special pre-event edits ourselves.
{%- if room == 'curlyboi' %}
- The AV team will be in touch to help out, as we're expecting to help edit some videos for this track specifically.
{%- endif %}

{% endif %}

Please also look through our AV team's **quality tips**. They're really important reading, so we've made the button to go read them very big and very green.

<div class='center-content'>
<a href="/tips" class='btn btn-chonk'>I want to look (and sound) good!</a>
</div>

{% if type == 'pre-record' %}

### Preferred format

- Format: MP4 H.264 with AAC audio (Handbrake preset “Youtube HQ 1080 or 720”).
- Video Bitrate: At least 2.5mbit.
- Audio Bitrate: At least 160kbit, mono or stereo.
- File size: Under 4GB
- Filename: DateOfPresentation_TitleOfPresentation_Author.mp4 (i.e. 2020-09-08_MyTalkTitle_RyanVerner.mp4).

{% endif %}


{% if type == 'live' %}

## Before the day

We will be holding a tech test and rehearsal session on 22&ndash;23 August, which you will need to book a time for. We'll send out more details closer to the date.


## On the day, before your talk

Our community platform will be [Venueless](https://venueless.org); that's where all of our speakers and attendees will be gathering. The videos will feed into there from a video streaming system 

- **Two hours before** your talk, go into the **green room chat** on Venueless, and let the channel know you have arrived for a tech check. The AV team will help check your set-up, and give last minute advice.
- **10 minutes before** your talk, the green room AV team will check you are ready. If you are not, your talk might get skipped!
- **5 minutes before** your talk, a "virtual curtain" will drop, and you'll be given a link to connect to the studio. When you open that link, you'll be able to see and hear the stream return video feed, and the **backstage chat**.
- **1 minute before** your talk, the virtual curtain will lift, and the MC will introduce you. (You'll see them and hear their voice through the stream return.)

{%- if room == 'curlyboi' %}
Note that the stream you're on is a little different from the others&mdash;the AV team will get in touch with you beforehand to provide more information on how your stream will be managed.
{% endif %}

## During your talk

Your talk will run for **15, 25, or 55 minutes**, depending on what you selected when you submitted your proposal.

Your options for taking questions are:

- Accept questions live on the stream. The MC will curate questions and read them to you. If you choose this option, question time is **included in your talk time**.
- Discuss questions after the talk, via the "hallway" channels we provide (there will be text-only, audio and video options).
- Decline to take questions.

At the 5, 2, and 1 minute marks you'll get a countdown message in the backstage chat. **At the end of your allotted time** the MC will come back on stream, thank you for presenting, and the "virtual curtain" will drop.

**Talks will not be allowed to run over**, so the MC may have to interrupt you if you don't wrap up in time; to avoid this, make sure you have the stream chat open!

## After your talk

As soon as the curtain drops you can leave the studio. (In fact, you'll be encouraged to rather quickly, because our changeover procedures are tight!) We'd love it if you could then go into one of the "hallway track" spaces we provide, but you don't have to.

{% elif type == 'pre-record' %}
## On the day

On the day, **you'll need to be online in Venueless, our community platform** to answer questions during your talk. You don't need to go anywhere special&mdash;just join the room like an ordinary attendee.

{% endif %}

## Video uploads

Some time after the event, if you've given us permission to, we'll upload the video from your talk to YouTube. These videos will be published under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.

## Conduct and expectations

Please ensure your talk content and slides comply with [our code of conduct](/conduct). This includes your own behaviour as well as anything you endorse or encourage.

In particular:

- Don't include content where you attack or pentest conference networks, conference infrastructure, conference processes, or conference attendees, in any way.
- If you are talking about past hacks or social engineering, you must have had informed consent for any system or person affected, and you must clearly indicate that this was the case.

If you're not sure whether something you want to present complies with the code of conduct, or you want more information, contact [speakers@pycon.org.au](mailto:speakers@pycon.org.au).

## Content warnings

If your talk contains content that you think might be sensitive, distressing or traumatic to some people (even if most people will be fine with it) please add a content warning, which you can do by [editing your accepted talk proposal](https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2020/me/submissions/) in Pretalx.

Content warnings aren't a moral judgement on your talk, and they won't restrict who is able to watch it. In fact, the opposite is true&mdash;for some of your audience members, if they know something they find distressing is coming up, they'll be better able to handle it than if it's a surprise. That lets them look after their mental health **and** better engage with and learn from your talk!

Some examples of content warnings follow:

> This talk contains extensive discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout.

> This talk contains images and brief mentions of bushfires and other natural disasters.

**Content warnings don't exempt you from the code of conduct.** This is for things that comply with the code of conduct, but might be distressing to some people.

## What to do if something comes up

Sometimes things happen!

Laptops run out of power, slides go missing, family stuff comes up, physical or mental health problems can occur. If anything comes up at any point, please let Benno (our Program Chair) or one of the other conference organisers know. We have an experienced organising team who can help with a broad range of questions, issues, or concerns. The sooner you let us know if there is a problem, the sooner we can work with you to achieve the best possible outcome.

If you’re just unsure and need to clarify something, email [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au). 

If you have an issue that should involve our Safety Team, contact details will be made available at the event. Less immediate issues of Conduct can be emailed to [safety@pycon.org.au](mailto:safety@pycon.org.au).
