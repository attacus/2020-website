abstract: "<p>Biometrics are widely regarded by the public, and many developers, as\
  \ heightened security. Their actual track record tells a very different story. Biometric\
  \ technologies are systematically making the world a less safe place. We have an\
  \ obligation to do something about that. And we can.</p>\n<p>In this talk, you'll\
  \ learn about the breathtaking range of biometrics being tracked and assessed. You'll\
  \ learn about dangerously wrong conclusions being drawn. You'll learn about spurious\
  \ underlying premises and untrustworthy training data, and widespread misuses that\
  \ are determining life and death decisions in government, policing, and health monitoring.</p>\n\
  <p>Most importantly, you'll learn how to assess these technologies, and avoid contributing\
  \ ito their development, misuse, and proliferation.</p>"
description: "<h2>TOPICS:</h2>\n<p>Categories and examples of biometrics, including\
  \ lesser-known categories such as affectmetrics and stylometrics.</p>\n<p>How they're\
  \ applied to uses far afield from authentication and access control.</p>\n<p>Discriminatory\
  \ datasets and outcomes.</p>\n<p>False premises of scientific accuracy.</p>\n<p>Spurious\
  \ conclusions being drawn and applied to life and death decision-making.</p>\n<p>Examples\
  \ of real-world practices from countries around the world, in which biometrics are\
  \ being misapplied, misused, and abused by government agencies, police, and individuals.</p>\n\
  <p>Among these: COVID-19 infection control, prison sentencing and probation, social\
  \ services eligiblity for vulnerable individuals, stalking, immigration and asylum\
  \ decision-making, bypassing legal constraints and democratic norms, undermining\
  \ protest movements and political dissent, human rights violations, and ongoing\
  \ racial and religious genocide in multiple countries.</p>\n<p>Note: examples are\
  \ drawn from a globally-diverse range of countries.</p>\n<h2>TAKEAWAYS:</h2>\n<p>How\
  \ to find peer-reviewed research of biometrics and related fields such as medicine,\
  \ physiology, psychology, cognitive science, law, and ethnic studies.</p>\n<p>How\
  \ to avoid being misled by pseudoscience, discredited training data, unsupported\
  \ premises, misleading claims, and outdated research.</p>\n<p>Ways to avoid contributing\
  \ your talents toward making a more dangerous world.</p>"
