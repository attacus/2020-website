abstract: <p>Ever taken a statistics class and wondered whether you were skilled enough
  for a data science career? This one's for you! Learn about some common statistical
  methods that you've definitely heard of, which happen to be very common in data
  science as well. With this talk, I aim to help aspiring data scientists from non-computer
  science disciplines realize how important and relevant their expertise to data science.</p>
description: "<p>Starting a career in data science may seem daunting for folks from\
  \ non-computer science backgrounds. You need to learn how to code, understand machine\
  \ learning algorithms, maybe even pick up linear algebra. The good news is, for\
  \ those who have done coursework or projects involving statistics, half of the battle\
  \ has already been won!</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will discuss common statistical\
  \ methods that are frequently used in data science: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>generalized\
  \ linear models, </li>\n<li>principal component analysis</li>\n<li>the beloved box\
  \ plot! </li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will talk about how their applications in statistics\
  \ and machine learning differ and show how they can be implemented in Python. With\
  \ this talk, I aim to help aspiring data scientists from various disciplines (e.g.,\
  \ social sciences, medicine) realize that their expertise is relevant to data science\
  \ and hopefully encourage them to pursue careers in this field.</p>"
