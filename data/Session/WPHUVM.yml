abstract: <p>Programs, applications, and websites, as the building block of our computing
  interfaces, create artificial borders that separate data, prevent reuse, and destroy
  any hope of a truly expressive and programmatic computing environment. We look at
  how this happened, what alternatives are possible, and how Python can help get us
  there.</p>
description: "<p>Think about adding up some numbers in a tabular structure. That's\
  \ straightforward with Python. But what if that same table is in a web page, or\
  \ a mobile app, or a PDF? It's right there on the screen, it's probably encoded\
  \ as a table in the markup. So the data is there. And yet, we can't query it.</p>\n\
  <p>Maybe if we copy-and-paste it we can query it. Or maybe we can download the page,\
  \ save it to disk, write code to load the page, parse the table, and dump the data\
  \ into a database.</p>\n<p>But why should we need to do any of those things? Why\
  \ can't we just query it directly?</p>\n<p>There's a wall around each app preventing\
  \ this. A program is in the way, blocking our path to expressiveness and computing\
  \ freedom. Much like great nations, great software should build bridges, not walls.</p>\n\
  <p>What would software look like, beyond standalone applications? What would software\
  \ look like without walls?</p>\n<p>By the end of this talk you'll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See\
  \ why the boundaries of software are much more political than technical</li>\n<li>Know\
  \ the history of attempts to bridge the application boundary - Smalltalk, Plan 9,\
  \ naked objects, the semantic web, and see where they succeeded and where they failed</li>\n\
  <li>See why object-orientation failed to live up the the hype, but why it might\
  \ yet succeed: What if all the objects within our Python programs could interact\
  \ more freely?</li>\n<li>Experience some demos and concepts of a computing experience,\
  \ where we write Python and run code without discrete applications at all.</li>\n\
