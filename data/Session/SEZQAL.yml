abstract: <p>There exists some beautiful mathematical models of economies and disease
  that offer insights, for instance, into how our economies can crash. Traditionally,
  exploring these models have involved a lot of specialist mathematical programming.
  Here we showcase a small python framework that simplifies the programming of these
  kinds of models by leveraging python libraries such as dash and scipy. The framework
  exposes a built-in UI that allows an interactive exploration of how economies might
  collapse, or diseases break out into epidemics.</p>

  \ these models that explain some aspect of our world, I have built a python framework\
  \ to simplify and enhance the exploration of these models. The framework provides\
  \ an instant UI that allows a visual interaction with the model.</p>\n<h2>Outline</h2>\n\
