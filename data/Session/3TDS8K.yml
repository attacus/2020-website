abstract: "<p>Staircase is a new python package on the data analysis scene, providing\
  \ a framework built around the notion of step-functions.  A rich variety of methods,\
  \ which follow from the algebra of functions, including arithmetic operations, relational\
  \ operations, logical operations allow for sophisticated analysis which may otherwise\
  \ prove challenging.  In addition, the package provides functionality for univariate\
  \ analysis, aggregations and compatibility with pandas.Timestamp.</p>\n<p>The creation\
  \ of this package was primarily motivated by the need for rapid analysis of timestamped\
  \ data, but also as an exercise in package development.  In addition to exploring\
  \ the use of the library, this talk will also reflect on lessons learned along the\
  \ way.</p>"
