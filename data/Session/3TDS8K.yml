abstract: <p>Staircase is a new python package on the data analysis scene, providing
  a framework built around the notion of step-functions.  A rich variety of methods,
  which follow from the algebra of functions, including arithmetic operations, relational
  operations, logical operations allow for sophisticated analysis which may otherwise
  prove challenging or time consuming.  In addition, the package provides functionality
  for univariate analysis, aggregations and compatibility with pandas.Timestamp.</p>
