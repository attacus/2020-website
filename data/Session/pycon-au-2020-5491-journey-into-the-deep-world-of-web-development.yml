abstract: <p>A story of a construction project manager who fell into the deep world
  of Django and Python</p>
description: "<p>Are you from a non-tech industry but wanting to learn web development?\
  \ Have you tried doing the official Django tutorial and had no idea what was going\
  \ on?</p>\n<p>This talk is a story about how I learnt Django and Python coming from\
  \ a non-tech industry, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This talk covers tips for beginners\
  \ on how best to get started with Django and Python. The talk covers the mistakes\
  \ that I've made, resources that I found useful, and how I created connections both\
  \ online and offline. The talk also explores the differences between the tech and\
  \ construction industry and how exciting things can happen when they learn from\
  \ each other.</p>"
