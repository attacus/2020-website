abstract: "<p>The Girls’ Programming Network has a well tested formula for getting\
  \ girls to love coding, used around Australia. It involves big events where girls\
  \ can do hands-on coding and unplugged activities, socialise with each other and\
  \ meet mentors. It’s all about breaking stereotypes by seeing heaps of girls and\
  \ women like you, enjoying things alongside you. But when pandemic strikes, is maintaining\
  \ a community based on connection even possible? We were left wondering if it was\
  \ even possible to run an online version of GPN that stays true to our values? Would\
  \ girls even want to sign up to more hours of online learning? </p>\n<p>The answer\
  \ to all of those questions is yes, we created an online program that rivaled our\
  \ in person offering. And while we can’t wait to meet up in person again, we’re\
  \ on a mission to make GPN Online catch on permanently to change the landscape of\
  \ girls in tech for all girls across Australia.</p>"
description: "<p>The Girl’s Programming Network has been making girls fall in love\
  \ with coding for 12 years, in this time we’ve established a tried and tested program\
  \ that girls love, love to come back to, and love to tell their friends about, which\
  \ is now used around Australia. But in the face of the pandemic, what were we going\
  \ to do? With our largest events having over 200 people in attendance, it was clear\
  \ that our regular offering would be off the table for quite some time. But we simply\
  \ couldn’t just let the girls in tech dream float idly by until the pandemic was\
  \ over. </p>\n<p>As with everything else, the only option was to go online and we\
  \ had to ask ourselves a lot of questions:\n“Can we actually deliver a program that\
  \ lives up to our values (Fun, Challenge, Social, Aspirational &amp; Relevant, Diverse,\
  \ Network) in an online format?”, “If we can’t live up to our values should we not\
  \ run it at all?”, “Will we get the community feeling that makes GPN more than just\
  \ a lesson?”, “Will girls even want to sign up given they are already doing home\
  \ schooling?”.</p>\n<p>Through great thought and consultation with our community\
  \ we orchestrated a model that rivals our in-person offering. I’ll take you through\
  \ the philosophy, the interwoven tech solution  (composed of Zoom, Slack and Grok\
  \ Learning), and the tricks and tips that meant we could take outreach online at\
  \ scale, without losing the interpersonal interactions and community spirit. We’ll\
  \ take a look together at what the kids said, how we managed to make it “nothing\
  \ like home schooling”. We even learned something we and you could use in your in-person\
  \ teaching.</p>\n<p>While we will by no means be getting rid of our in person events\
  \ forever, the end of COVID definitely won’t be an end of GPN Online. We have big\
  \ plans for our online model to take GPN to girls of regional and rural Australia.\
  \  While we have GPN nodes in many cities, even some regional centres already, much\
  \ of the country is still yet to join the GPN community. With our online model we\
  \ hope to reach the girls that would never make it to an in person GPN, and to boot\
  \ strap soon to be in person communities so they can hit the ground running with\
  \ a critical mass of girls who’ve started and collected online.</p>"
