abstract: <p>Excel is used a lot in businesses and other spheres; however, data in
  Excel can be messy and hard to extract data from. This talk aims to show how to
  safely navigate Excel <code>hell</code> and get the data you need.</p>
description: <p>Remember that Excel data that took you forever to pull data out from?
  Or those tables that you had to clean again, because you could not access them in
  the right way ? Or those color codings that mean something but you cannot capture?
  Or those numbers that are formatted in one way, but show up in another form or are
  hidden behind another layer of formatting? This talk will show how to use Pandas
  and Openpyxl, and some other make-life-easy tools to extract data from Excel and
  proceed to the next phase of our data analysis. Excel is not going anywhere, it
  is used widely, and sometimes can be a pain.  We can lessen the pain - this talk
  will show you how.</p>
