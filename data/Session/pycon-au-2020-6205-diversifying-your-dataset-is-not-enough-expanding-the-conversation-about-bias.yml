abstract: <p>Using machine learning for medicine as a case study, I'll illustrate
  some of the issues that aren't addressed by simply diversifying your training set,
  and point in the direction of issues beyond just a narrow framing of bias that we
  need to consider to avoid potential harms of algorithmic systems.</p>
description: <p>While it's important to consider the diversity of your dataset and
  the performance of your model across different demographic group, this is just a
  narrow slice of the issues we need to consider related to bias and fairness.  Using
  machine learning for medicine as a case study, I'll illustrate some of the broader
  considerations related to bias, power, and participation that we need to take into
  account.</p>
