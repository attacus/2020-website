Microsoft helps developers achieve more. You may already be familiar with our suite of tools for python practitioners such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/pyconlineau/vscode ) and [Microsoft Azure](https://aka.ms/pyconlineau/azure). For developers new to Python we have a 44 episode [Introduction to Python](https://aka.ms/pyconlineau/learnpython) series, while all developers, data scientists and engineers can use [Microsoft Learn](https://aka.ms/pyconlineau/learn) to learn new skills in the cloud – all completely for free. 

We’re excited to support PyConline AU and the extremely online event this year. Say hi to our team in chat – we can't wait to see you there.
