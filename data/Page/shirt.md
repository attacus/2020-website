# PyConline AU Merch

We know that attendees love our shirts every year. This year, given our digital nature, we've opened up a storefront on RedBubble where you can order your conference shirts, and other merch!

Our design this year comes from [Tania Walker](http://taniawalker.com/), the wonderful designer behind our curly boi and [branding](http://taniawalker.com/pyconau/). 

Profits made from merch sales will go directly into running next years event.
