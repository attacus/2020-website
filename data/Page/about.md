# About the conference

PyConline AU 2020 will be held on the Internet, in the Curlyboi Convention Centre.

More about when, and how, this is all going to work will be announced soon; right now, everything is changing and everyone is trying to figure out how to react to that change, us included.

The rest of this page is about what an in-person PyCon AU is traditionally like. We're trying to keep as much of the essence of as much of this as we can as we move to online.

## Specialist tracks

Traditionally, the first day of PyCon AU is dedicated to specialist tracks. These tracks, also known as ‘miniconfs’, are curated by smaller specialist groups within Python community, and allow for more in-depth talks on the subject.

## Conference main track

Traditionally, the weekend of PyCon AU is the main conference event. We invite speakers from all backgrounds and levels of knowledge to share their experience and knowledge with our audience.

## Development sprints

Following three days of talks, we've previously held space in our venue for two days of Development Sprints (sometimes shortened just to ‘Sprints’)

Development Sprints provide an unstructured location for projects and contributors to work in real time on their projects, or for people to hack about with various things with people with experts in their fields.

The conference would have provided copious amounts of table space, power, and internet connectivity. Since we're now on the Internet, these things are all unfortunately BYO.

## About PyCon AU

PyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.

PyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.
