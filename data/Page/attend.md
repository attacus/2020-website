# Attend PyConline AU!

We’re excited to share that tickets are now available for PyConline AU!

As with previous years, we have several types of tickets priced at different levels:

- **Contributor** tickets this year are a “Pay what you want” ticket that helps support the longevity of PyCon AU and fund outreach and diversity programs (such as covering affordable access for students) for this and future years. All contributors will be recognised as minor sponsors.
- **Professional** tickets are for professional Python users attending the conference. If your employer is paying for your ticket or you make a living using Python, please consider this tier.
- **Enthusiast** tickets is your ‘general admission’ ticket to the conference, regardless of your python proficiency.
- **Student** tickets are available for anyone enrolled in full or part-time  educational courses at any level. (Where possible, please register using your institution email address).

We’ll have more to share about our (extremely) online conference venue in the next few weeks. For now, you can expect to receive an invite link to your registered email address closer to the date. If you purchase multiple tickets (e.g. for a team to attend the conference), you’ll be prompted to enter an email address for each attendee so they can receive invite links nearer the time.
