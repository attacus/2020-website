# Attend PyConline AU!

We’re excited to share that tickets are now available for PyConline AU!

As with previous years, we have several types of tickets priced at different levels:

- **Contributor** tickets are our top tier ticket. Contributors are recognised as minor sponsors because the ticket price helps fund outreach and diversity programs (such as covering affordable access for students). This year you can also “pay what you want” above the listed price.
- **Professional** tickets are for professional Python users attending the conference. If your employer is paying for your ticket or you make a living using Python, please consider this tier.
- **Enthusiast** tickets is your ‘general admission’ ticket to the conference, regardless of your python proficiency.
- **Student** tickets are available for anyone enrolled in full or part-time educational courses, at any level, in Australia or New Zealand. (Where possible, please register using your institution email address).

## I've got my ticket! What now?

You'll be able to access it via your order confirmation email, and if you've lost that you can [request another from the "resend order links" page](https://pretix.eu/pyconau/online2020/resend/).

You don't need any special software&mdash;just any modern Web browser. You'll need a webcam and microphone to voice and video chat with other attendees, but that's optional.

If you purchase multiple tickets (e.g. for a team to attend the conference), you’ll be prompted to enter an email address for each attendee so they can receive invite links.
