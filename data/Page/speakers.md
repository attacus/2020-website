# Information for speakers

You have the option of either presenting live or pre-recording. If you haven't decided yet, it's a good idea to read the information for both options before you do.

If you're presenting in the main conference, but you haven't yet been told which room you're in, start with the "other rooms" option.

## New!
Information about our backstage platform (discord), tech-checks, and when to check-in for your talk is available in our [backstage guide for speakers](/backstage). This guidance is for all speakers, and in all channels, specialist tracks, live/pre-recording etc.

If you've recieved your invitation to register as a speaker and are wondering whats next, this is the page to read. ☝️
