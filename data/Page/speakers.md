# Information for speakers

You have the option of either presenting live or pre-recording. If you haven't decided yet, it's a good idea to read the information for both options before you do.

If you're presenting in the main conference, but you haven't yet been told which room you're in, start with the "other rooms" option.

## If you are presenting live:

- [Science, Data and Analytics](/speakers/specialist/curlyboi/live/)
- [Other specialist tracks](/speakers/specialist/other/live/)
- [Main conference, Curlyboi Theatre](/speakers/main/curlyboi/live/)
- [Main conference, other rooms](/speakers/main/other/live/)

## If you are pre-recording:

- [Science, Data and Analytics](/speakers/specialist/curlyboi/pre-record/)
- [Other specialist tracks](/speakers/specialist/other/pre-record/)
- [Main conference, Curlyboi Theatre](/speakers/main/curlyboi/pre-record/)
- [Main conference, other rooms](/speakers/main/other/pre-record/)
